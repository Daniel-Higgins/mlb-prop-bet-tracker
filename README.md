THE MLB PROP BET TRACKER

This web application keeps track of all prop bets made by users.

Users sign in, and can place 1 wager a day (under -300 odds) on any MLB player to record a Hit. 

Users can view all the pending wagers for the day, and even parlay it if they choose on the respective sportsbook site.

Users can also view a leaderboard of how well they, and others, have been betting throughout the course of the MLB season and even view all the history bets players have made.
The beauty of this web app is that it is a system of checks and balances where any one person can update the pending bets page, and anyone can see all the history bets and report if an error has been made.
